# Getcource scraper script
Pyton script for scraping pages in HTML format from websites made on the getcource platform

# Configuring the script
For it to work you need to:
 + change the 'site' variable to the required site
 + change the 'headers' variable for loging in to the site
 + change the 'start_url' variable to the page from wich you want to start scraping. The scraping will go on recursively untill it reaches the last nodes

aproximate speed of the scraper is 800 pages per minute (tested with 20 workers)
